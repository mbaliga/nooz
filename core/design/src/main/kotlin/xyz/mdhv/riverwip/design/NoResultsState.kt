/**
 * A literal no-results state (owner, 2026-07: "attaching exclamation
 * illustration I want you to use when there are no results"): the owner's
 * own illustration, tinted to the surrounding theme (it's shipped as a plain
 * alpha mask so it reads correctly in white, paper, and dark), a fixed
 * headline, and one dry line picked from [NO_RESULTS_QUOTES] below it. This
 * is distinct from [EmptyState] — that one explains *why* a list is empty
 * (no sources added, nothing clipped yet) with actionable guidance; this one
 * is for the narrower case of a search or filter that came up genuinely
 * empty, where there's nothing to explain and nothing to do but say so.
