"""
Turn the translation catalogues into what each platform actually reads.

WHY A GENERATOR AT ALL
Nooz has two front ends and one set of words. Keeping Android's strings.xml and
the web reader's catalogue as separate hand-maintained files means a translator
does every language twice, and the two drift the moment anyone is in a hurry --
which in practice means the web reader stays English. One source, two outputs,
so "the web reader must also do the same" is structural rather than a promise.

SOURCE OF TRUTH
  i18n/strings/en.json    the base catalogue: key -> English
  i18n/strings/<tag>.json a translation, keyed the same way

Text in these files is plain and human: real apostrophes, real quotes, no
platform escaping. Escaping belongs to whichever platform needs it, and doing it
here would put backslashes in front of a translator.

A translation may be partial. Any key it omits falls back to English -- Android
resolves per key, and the web layer does the same -- so a locale can ship at a
third done and show that third. Never a blank, never a key name.

OUTPUTS (both generated; edit the JSON, not these)
  core/design/src/main/res/values-<qualifier>/strings.xml
  web/i18n/<tag>.json

Run:  python3 tools/i18n/generate.py          write the outputs
      python3 tools/i18n/generate.py --check  fail if they are out of date (CI)

  ADDING A LANGUAGE
  Drop i18n/strings/<bcp47>.json next to en.json, translate the values, run the
  generator. That is the whole procedure \u2014 no Kotlin, no build change.
  Locales.kt in :core:model is the list the app offers.

  Android resolves each string separately and falls back to this file per key,
  so a half-finished locale shows the half it has and English for the rest.
  Never a blank, never a key name. Partial translations are therefore safe to
  ship, which is what makes it possible to start thirty languages rather than
  finish two.

  WRITING THE COPY
  The register is set in STATE.md and is not decoration: descriptive, never
  scolding; shapes and counts, never FOMO or praise; and every total carries its
  denominator \u2014 the reader's own chosen sources, never "all the news". A
  translation that reads naturally but drops the denominator has changed what
  the app claims, so keep it.
