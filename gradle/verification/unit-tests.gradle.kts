//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ci.yml asked for `testDebugUnitTest testFossDebugUnitTest testFullDebugUnitTest`,
// which reads like "all of them" and is not. Those are Android variant tasks.
// `:core:model` is a plain `kotlin.jvm` module, so its task is `test` — and it
// is the most-tested module in the repo. Twenty-seven test files (Simhash,
// Dedup, ArticleSearch, the feed parser, OPML, the classifier) had never been
// executed by CI, and nothing said so: the build went green because every task
// that was asked for passed.
//
// A hand-maintained list of task names has the same failure mode the moment
// someone adds a module, so this discovers them instead — and fails loudly if a
// module has test sources it cannot find a task for.

// today; kept so that an exclusion has to be written down rather than happening
// by accident, which is exactly how :core:model went missing.

// projectsEvaluated, not each project's own afterEvaluate: AGP registers its
// variant tasks from inside its own afterEvaluate hook, so a callback added
// here runs first and sees an Android module as having no test task at all —
// which the check below would then report as an error. Waiting until every
// project is evaluated is the difference between "no such task" and "not yet".
