/**
 * "What's inside" — the short tour of the things a reader will otherwise never
 * find.
 *
 * Nooz hides almost nothing behind a menu: the Loom opens by *pulling down on
 * the stand*, Clippings by a bookmark inside the reader, and Flash, Cast and
 * Today in History are all deliberately **off** until switched on (each is
 * either a standing generation over everything that flowed, or the one fetch
 * this app makes to somewhere the reader didn't add). Every one of those is a
 * defensible design decision on its own, and together they add up to a set of
 * features nobody discovers. This is the counterweight: five lines, each
 * naming a thing and saying where it lives.
 *
 * Deliberately **not** a set of toggles. Flash and Cast each pull down a model,
 * and "off until you decide" is the whole point of how they ship — flipping
 * that decision on a reader's behalf during setup, before the words mean
 * anything to them, would trade one bad outcome for a worse one. So the tour
 * points at the switch instead of being the switch.
 *
 * Shared on purpose: onboarding shows it once as a send-off, and Settings
 * keeps it permanently, because every reader who onboarded before this existed
 * would otherwise never see it at all.
